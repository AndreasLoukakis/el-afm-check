el-afm-check
============

Check greek companies AFM (αριθμός φορολογικού μητρώου) number from europa.eu web services.
gsis seems to have problems responding most of the time.

Includes client side VAT check for validity (which will not make sure it is a company AFM) then allow to submit and echo any results returned.
As simple as it can get.
